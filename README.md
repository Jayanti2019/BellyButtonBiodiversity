# BellyButtonBiodiversity
## Purpose
Purpose for this project to visualize the bacterial data for volunteers. Specifically  volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
## Results
We created 3 different charts to do the visualization.
